A template for slide decks that include code snippets in a language of your choice (Java, Groovy, or Kotlin).

The content of your slides is written in [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/) and converted to
an HTML presentation powered by [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/).

The code snippets in your presentation are taken from a codebase.
This ensures that your slides always contain valid and up-to-date code. 
You can include whole source code files or only portions of them.

A Gradle script lets you build the codebase and generate the HTML presentation.
